# Deprecated and Obsolete!

I'm moving this into two separate (and up to date) repositories:
 - [CiderChain API](https://github.com/johnmetta/ciderchain_api): The Rails API backend
 - [CiderChain Client](https://github.com/johnmetta/ciderchain_client): The React front end

Note, both of those are still broken, as I'm doing a pretty ham-fisted code migration in order to build up from clean Rails and React projects.
